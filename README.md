![How to navigate to releases page](https://github.com/MyroslavMay/DoodyIDE/blob/main/screenshots/setup/go-to-releases.png?raw=true)
2. Scroll a little, you will find binaries for your OS (as on picture). Download a correct, then run the setup (if download installer), or unzip it somewhere and run main .exe (on Linux, you may need to do in executable). This works if you downloaded portable version.

## If you wanna to compile it, follow this steps
**Requiments: Node.js (with npm)**
> [!TIP]
> We recommend using Node.js version 22, but it can work with new versions.

1. Clone this repo (with `Github Desktop` or `Git`). If you using `Git` method, use this commands:
```
cd <CLONE_TO_DIR> # replace <CLONE_TO_DIR> with your directory
git clone https://github.com/MyroslavMay/DoodyIDE
cd DoodyIDE
```
2. Open your terminal (or IDE's integrated terminal), and run this commands
```
npm install # installs all dependencies
```
3. After that, you can test app bu running:
```
npm run dev # start app in development mode
```
4. To finish playing around, just close app.
5. Next, you need to choose your build target. It can be Linux, Windows or MacOS
> [!NOTE]
> Electron is supported to build cross-platform build (e.g. You building Windows build from Linux), but it can be broken. You may search on Internet how to solve this issue. But we recomend not doing cross-platform build at all.
