# How to run it
**__NOTE: currently, there are prebuilded binaries for Windows (x64) (Installer or portable) and Linux (x86_64) (portable), but it is untested. So try it out and share your results or Issues page!__**
## If you want to use prebuided binaries (Linux or Windows), follow this steps
1. Go to `Releases` page
![How to navigate to releases page](https://github.com/MyroslavMay/DoodyIDE/blob/main/screenshots/setup/go-to-releases.png?raw=true)
2. Scroll a little, you will find binaries for your OS (as on picture). Download a correct, then run the setup (if download installer), or unzip it somewhere and run main .exe (on Linux, you may need to do in executable). This works if you downloaded portable version.

## If you wanna to compile it, follow this steps
**Requiments: Node.js (with npm)**
> [!TIP]
> We recommend using Node.js version 22, but it can work with new versions.

1. Clone this repo (with `Github Desktop` or `Git`). If you using `Git` method, use this commands:
```
cd <CLONE_TO_DIR> # replace <CLONE_TO_DIR> with your directory
git clone https://github.com/MyroslavMay/DoodyIDE
cd DoodyIDE
```
2. Open your terminal (or IDE's integrated terminal), and run this commands
```
npm install # installs all dependencies
```
3. After that, you can test app bu running:
```
npm run dev # start app in development mode
```
> [!WARNING]
> We recommend running app in development mode (as shown before) to test it out. This makes sure that you not get corrupted copy of repo.

> [!TIP]
> ViteJS is supporting HMR (hot module replacement). This means, if you do some changes to code, it will automaticlly reload app.
4. To finish playing around, just close app.
5. Next, you need to choose your build target. It can be Linux, Windows or MacOS
> [!NOTE]
> Electron is supported to build cross-platform build (e.g. You building Windows build from Linux), but it can be broken. You may search on Internet how to solve this issue. But we recomend not doing cross-platform build at all.
6. Next, you may run command to build your app (depending on your OS). The list of commands are here:
+ `npm run build:win` for building on Windows
+ `npm run build:mac` for building on MacOS
+ `npm run build:mac_icon` for building on MacOS (with app icon)
+ `npm run build:linux` for building on Linux
Feel free to explore `package.json` file.
